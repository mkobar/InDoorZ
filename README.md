InDoorZ
===============

For the 2015 NYU ABILITY Technology Hackathon

## Wayfinding for Buildings and Campus Settings 

InDoorZ is a wayfinding app for indoor travel, especially useful for those with low vision or other disabilities. But it is able to be used by everyone.

It has been designed for text-to-speech applications, to allow directions in both a visual and audible way.

Gus discussed the many challenges that a low vision or blind person has navigating around outside with the current technology and also discussed the lack of similar applications for indoor navigation.

And I just wanted to work on a geo-location app and have found indoor mapping a good challenge.
